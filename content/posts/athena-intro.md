## What is Amazon Athena?

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) using standard SQL. It's serverless, so there's no infrastructure to set up or manage. Athena scales automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries.

## Why was Athena created?

Athena was created to provide a simple and cost-effective way to analyze large amounts of data stored in S3. As data volumes grow, traditional data warehousing and business intelligence tools can struggle to keep up. These tools often require you to load data into a separate environment for analysis, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Athena addresses these challenges by allowing you to analyze data directly where it is stored, in S3, without the need for complex ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs.

## Use Cases

1. **Log Analysis**: If you have application logs or web server logs stored in S3, you can use Athena to analyze these logs for insights such as user behavior patterns or system performance issues.

2. **Data Lake Analytics**: Athena is ideal for quick, ad-hoc querying of your data lake. You can analyze all your data in S3 without having to move it to a separate storage or compute environment.

3. **ETL Jobs**: Athena can be used as part of your ETL jobs to transform data or to verify the output of your transformation process.

## Schema-on-read Approach

Unlike traditional databases that use a schema-on-write approach, Athena uses a schema-on-read approach. This means it applies a schema to the data at the time of querying, not at the time of storing. As a result, you don't need to define your schema in advance of loading data. This gives you the flexibility to use Athena with any data format that has a corresponding SerDe (serializer/deserializer), and to view the data in multiple formats based on different schemas.

## Costs

Athena charges you only for the queries that you run. You're charged based on the amount of data scanned by each query, not the data returned. The current price is $5 per terabyte scanned, but this can be reduced by compressing, partitioning, or converting your data into a columnar format.

The tables and views you create in Athena are just metadata; they don't store data or incur any additional costs. However, there is a small cost to store this metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

# Tutorial: Querying S3 Files with Athena

Let's go through a step-by-step process to query S3 files using Athena.

## Step 1: Set Up

First, you'll need to sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Athena console.

## Step 2: Create a Database

In the Athena query editor, run a CREATE DATABASE statement to create a new database. This database will hold your table definitions.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

Absolutely, I apologize for the oversight. Let's add more details to the Create Table section and discuss how indexing and partitioning work in the context of Athena.

## Step 3: Create a Table

Amazon Athena uses Apache Hive to define tables and create a schema for the data. When you create a table in Athena, you're essentially associating it with your data stored in S3. This data could be in various formats such as CSV, JSON, or Parquet, among others. The schema you define in Athena will be used to interpret the data when you run SQL queries.

For instance, if your data is stored in JSON format, you might define your table like so:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase.mytable (
  `column1` string,
  `column2` int,
  -- add all columns from your data
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://mybucket/myjsonfiles/';
```

This `ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'` clause tells Athena to interpret the data as JSON format.

If your S3 data is stored in other formats (parquet, csv, tsv, etc) you need to specify a different format for *FORMAT SERDE*.
[See examples here]({{< ref "#s3_formats" >}} "Specifying S3 Data Formats in Athena Using SerDes and Input Formats")

## Indexing and Partitioning

Athena does not support traditional database indexes. Instead, it takes advantage of data partitioning to reduce the amount of data it needs to scan, which can significantly improve query performance and reduce costs. Partitioning in Athena works by segregating data into different folders based on a certain column (partition key) in your data.

For example, if you have a large amount of sales data spread across multiple years, you could partition your data by the `year` column. This way, when you query for a specific year's data, Athena only scans the data in the corresponding partition, rather than scanning the entire dataset.

Here's how you might create a partitioned table:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase.mytable (
  `column1` string,
  `column2` int
  -- add all non-partition columns from your data
)
PARTITIONED BY (year string)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://mybucket/mypartitioneddata/';
```

After creating a partitioned table, you'll need to load the partitions using the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` command:

```sql
MSCK REPAIR TABLE mydatabase.mytable;
```

This command instructs Athena to scan the S3 directory and update the partitions.

Remember that partitioning should be planned in accordance with your query patterns for the best performance improvements. The partition key (like `year` in the above example) should ideally be a column that you frequently use as a filter in your WHERE clauses.
## Step 4: Query Your Data

Now you can query your data. In the Athena query editor, you might run a SELECT statement like the following:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM mydatabase.mytable
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will return the first 10 rows of data from your S3 files.

Athena is a powerful tool for querying large datasets in S3. With its serverless architecture and cost-effective pricing, it's a great choice for ad-hoc data exploration and analysis. Happy querying!

## Specifying S3 Data Formats in Athena Using SerDes and Input Formats {#s3_formats}

Amazon Athena uses the Apache Hive DDL for creating tables, and Hive uses SerDes (short for Serializer/Deserializer) to interpret the data that it reads from and writes to tables. Depending on your data's format in S3, you can specify different SerDes in the `ROW FORMAT SERDE` clause.

Here are some common data formats and the associated SerDes:

1. **CSV**: If your data is in CSV format, you would use the `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde` SerDe.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE mydatabase.mytable (
  `column1` string,
  `column2` int,
  -- add all columns from your data
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde'
LOCATION 's3://mybucket/mycsvdata/';
```

2. **JSON**: As previously mentioned, for JSON data, you would use the `org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe` SerDe.

3. **Parquet**: If your data is in Parquet format, the `STORED AS PARQUET` clause is used instead of `ROW FORMAT SERDE`.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE mydatabase.mytable (
  `column1` string,
  `column2` int,
  -- add all columns from your data
)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION 's3://mybucket/myparquetdata/';
```

4. **ORC**: For ORC format data, the `STORED AS ORC` clause is used.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE mydatabase.mytable (
  `column1` string,
  `column2` int,
  -- add all columns from your data
)
STORED AS ORC
LOCATION 's3://mybucket/myorcdata/';
```

5. **Avro**: If your data is in Avro format, you would use the `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.avro.AvroSerDe` SerDe.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE mydatabase.mytable (
  `column1` string,
  `column2` int,
  -- add all columns from your data
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.avro.AvroSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://mybucket/myavrodata/';
```

6. **Textfiles**: For plain text files, you can use the `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe` SerDe and specify the delimiter used in your data.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE mydatabase.mytable (
  `column1` string,
  `column2` int,
  -- add all columns from your data
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION 's3://mybucket/mytextdata/';
```

Remember to replace `'s3://mybucket/mycsvdata/'`, `'s3://mybucket/myparquetdata/'`, `'s3://mybucket/myorcdata/'`, `'s3://mybucket/myavrodata/'`, and `'s3://mybucket/mytextdata/'` with your actual S3 locations.

It's crucial to choose the SerDe that corresponds to your data format. Incorrect SerDe selection may lead to issues during the querying phase, resulting in inaccurate data retrieval or errors.
